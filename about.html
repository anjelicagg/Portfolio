<p>Hi (INSERT WAVING EMOJI) My name is Anjelica but you can call me Anj. I graduated from Penn State (Go Lions)! with my Bachelors in Business Management and Marketing. Since then I have worked in Talent Branding over the last several years and fell in love with Tech. Meeting so many amazing tech professionals inspired me to become one! So here I am a recent graduate of CodeSquad Bootcamp where I have learned so much and am excited to see what the future holds! </p> <br>
